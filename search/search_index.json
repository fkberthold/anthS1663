As the topic of this class focused on supernatural folklore, I chose to focus on the world created in the Fatal Frame series.</p> <p>Fatal Frame is a Japanese video game series that is set in a fictional, modern Japan\\(^1\\).  The game has third-person exploration paired with first-person style combat.  In each story, the player guides one or more characters through an abandoned environment that is haunted.  Something terrible has happened, a curse has fallen on this location, and the protagonist(s) become trapped and need to unravel the mystery of the location.  To facilitate their adventure, the player guides the characters through the environment from a third-person perspective.  In third-person, the player's view comes from behind the character, giving the player a wide-lens, forward-facing perspective of the environment.</p> <p>While the player leads the character through the environment, they will be attacked by various kinds of ghosts.  In order to defeat ghosts, the characters primarily make use of a camera, known in the game lore as the \"Camera Obscura\"\\(^2\\).  The player uses the camera to take pictures of the  ghosts, stealing spirit energy until the enemy is defeated.  When the player makes use of the Camera Obscura, the view shifts to a first-person perspective, and mimics a situation of the player looking through a camera to take pictures.  This removes peripheral view, narrowing how much the player can see of the environment, making them more vulnerable while increasing both dread and stress. </p> <p>The creator and director of this series is Makoto Shibata.  In a blog post Shibata wrote for the PlayStation.Blog site, he describes wanting to create a game where players would experience, emotionally and physically, the sensations one has when they encounter a ghost in real life\\(^3\\).  Shibata felt that the console hardware, originally the PlayStation 2, would give him the tools to recreate his own experiences of the supernatural\\(^4\\).  This is one example of many where Shibata talks about his own paranormal encounters, as well as dreams, Japanese folklore, and horror traditions that served as inspiration for the narratives and encounters in the Fatal Frame series.</p>"},{"location":"#my-project-the-folklore-catalog","title":"My Project: The Folklore Catalog","text":"<p>While reading these articles, I realized this was a perfect opportunity to catalog folklore that went into the creation of something folkloresque.  The folkloresque, as Foster describes the term, \"can be thought of as the popular, vernacular, folk conception of folklore\"\\(^5\\).  The folkloresque draws from many sources of folklore\\(^6\\), producing an often commercialized product that \"smells like folklore\"\\(^7\\).  The Fatal Frame series is consciously drawing on folkloric sources to intentionally create an atmosphere of the supernatural.  I did not so much have a thesis with this project as I had curiosity:  from the creator's point of view, what do those processes look like?  Further, is that process not itself a kind of folklore?</p> <p>To facilitate this catalog, I first collected as many interviews, blog posts, and articles I could find, via Google, about Shibata and his teams' inspiration and sources for the games, as well as their experiences during game making.  I am limited to English language articles as I do not read Japanese.  While there is a large treasure trove of interviews in Japanese, there are plenty to be found in English as well.  After collecting the material, I read each one carefully, taking note of any folklore items such as legends and memorates, as well as noting instances where inspiration came from dreams.</p> <p>Using these folkloric items I collected, I began constructing this catalog using a tool called Obsidian.  Obsidian makes use of markup and has a number of community built plugins and tools.  I made use of one of these tools to generate the markup files into something that I could publish online, and the results of that are what you see here.</p>"},{"location":"#some-things-to-note-about-each-entry","title":"Some things to note about each entry:","text":"<ol> <li>The top line of each page is the \"File Name\" for the entry.  File names are constructed in two parts:<ol> <li>The year in which the source document was published.  </li> <li>A key phrase taken from the folkloric item collected, making it easier for me to identify what the content contains.</li> </ol> </li> <li>I have given each folklore item a genre, or \"Folklore Type\".  These link to keyword files that contain a simple definition for each type.  Obsidian makes use of mapping tools that create visual webs of links between files.  This enables the user to visual patterns of connections between key concepts.  I created the keyword files to take advantage of that feature while for future research.</li> <li>The \"Contents\" section is the quoted folklore item that I am cataloging.</li> <li>The \"Context\" section provides information to contextualize the nature of the folklore item.</li> <li>The \"Source Information\" section contains the source citation, as well as additional information about the type of source and when it was collected.</li> <li>The \"Links\" section contains links to related files.  Some articles produced more than one folkloric item, and in that case, I've included those links in this section.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#ouroboros-folklore-to-folkloresque-to-folklore","title":"Ouroboros: Folklore to Folkloresque to Folklore","text":"<p>The work that went into putting this catalog together was a fascinating journey exploring the intentional folklore that went into making a folkloresque series.  There are several examples within the catalog of Shibata sharing memorates and pieces of legends, which are themselves folklore.  As with other examples of digital folklore such as Slender Man, more of the development processes are available for others to see and participate in.  As academics, we are fortunate to get a look behind the curtain and see the process of legends being born.</p> <p>Looking more towards the future of my research, I'm also fascinated by the processes of the folkloresque once again becoming folklore.  The Fatal Frame series has a very active fan base who have gone on to co-create new folklore based on the narratives found in the games.  Just by doing some light web searching, you'll find many examples of:</p> <ol> <li>People cosplaying their favorite characters or ghosts from the games.</li> <li>People who insert themselves into the digital environments or physically recreate scenes from their favorite game.</li> <li>Fan art.</li> <li>Fan fiction.</li> <li>Fan wiki pages dedicated to unraveling the lore of the games.</li> <li>Internet memes.</li> </ol> <p>There's really no end to the fan-created content and ostensive behaviors.  My favorite example of this comes from the first game in the series which features an abandoned location called \"Himuro Mansion\"\\(^8\\).  The first game was advertised as having been based on real events and a rumor began on the internet that Himuro Mansion was also based on a real location in Japan.  If you do a search for \"Himuro Mansion\" on Google you will come across a number of examples of people stating this is a real place.  Use it as a search term on YouTube, and you will find at least a couple of examples with people exploring the supposed location.  While Shibata would incorporate locations inspired on real places in Japan in later games (see 2021-Inspired_by_Aokigahara), Himuro Mansion is not likely an example of this.  What this is though is an example of how a rumor (a kind of pseudo-ostension) born out of a folkloresque narrative gives rise to even more folklore and ostensive behaviors.</p>"},{"location":"#how-we-play-or-co-creators-in-these-digital-realms","title":"How We Play, or Co-Creators in these Digital Realms","text":"<p>Considering some of the potential processes involved in the folkloresque generating folklore, I consider how my own folk groups engage in video gaming.  Many of my close friends and family are avid video gamers, and while gaming can certainly be a solitary endeavor, with us it tends to be something we do with others.  Take the Fatal Frame series for example:  we've played these games more than once, and each time it's been as a group.  We elect a victim, or should I say \"player,\" who leads the characters through the mysterious and dangerous environments of the Fatal Frame universe.  The rest of the group, far from passive in the endeavor, become active participants in the gameplay and narrative.  We react to jump scares, help look for clues to solve puzzles, or figure out where the character needs to be guided to next.  While this is all unfolding, spirited discussion of the narrative and lore unfolds in the group as we piece together the scattered bits of story and ponder the mysteries left in the narrative.</p> <p>The engagement with this secondary world doesn't stop when we put the game down.  We reminisce about playthroughs, debate meanings and missing lore, and tell others about our experiences.  Sometimes these experiences are themselves supernatural folklore:  the time we heard a voice where we hadn't in previous playthroughs, or the ghost that appeared in a place it hadn't been before.  There's something compelling about this world that we want to return to again and again, not just for the visceral experience of being scared, but to return to this digital world and narrative that we find so intriguing.  Shibata may have set out to create an experience of the supernatural that was tangible to those who haven't themselves experienced it in the \"real\" world, but in the process he created a world with real weight and substance.</p> <p>This is the future of my questions and research.  Here in this liminal space between real and imagined worlds, and between the loose definitions that make up what folklore and the folkloresque are.  What is so compelling about these kinds of folkloresque narratives, particularly for digital worlds?  What is the implication of \"it smells like folklore\"\\(^9\\).  We know these folkloresque and fictional worlds are \"not real,\" but as fans, we engage with them in ways that make it seem as though they are.  Is it a safe place with well established boundaries where we can go to escape, or is there something else happening here?  Where does folklore end and folkloresque begin?  So while I bring this part of the project to a close in order to meet a class deadline, I am aware that these questions just scratch the surface of what I'm interested in and I have so much more to explore.</p>"},{"location":"#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<ol> <li>Shibata, Makoto dir.

The rule of the game was that you had to bring something out of the house, such as a piece of paper, a book, a broken doll, or something like that. And we imagined what had happened in the house based on those items we brought out. It was thrilling to go into somewhere you shouldn't and collect fragmentary information there.

There was a custom concerning a character called the Dream Buyer, who was said to buy and sell good dreams. There was also an imaginary creature called Baku, and people believed that Baku ate nightmares. Baku is enshrined in some temples in Japan.</p> <p>In the context of PZ3 [Project Zero 3], the Manor of Sleep used to be a shrine that people used in ceremonies relating to a particular nightmare. This nightmare had a specific form. People who had lost someone close to them were beckoned by the departed through their dreams. If they followed the deceased, they would not wake up anymore.</p> <p>To combat the nightmare, it received a 'dedication' at the shrine. In other words, people dedicated the pain that they felt at the loss of their loved one to the shrine. However, the way they ritualised this nightmare was very special. They mixed the blood of surviving people and their dead relatives, and they put a tattoo on a Priestess's skin using the blood as paint.</p> <p>I won't go into too much detail, but there was an accident in the shrine. The people extended the Manor with a complicated structure to hide the accident. One day, all the people living in the region of the shrine did not wake up from their sleep. And the shrine was abandoned.</p> <p>In the present day, Rei visits the shrine in her job and from this moment on, she is called to the Manor in her dreams. The Manor is ruled by a priestess who is tattooed all over her body. People who are touched by her will wake up to find a tattoo on their body that expands every time they wake up. Suffering causes the tattoo to expand on the skin. This is the curse, and once the tattoo covers their eyes, they don't come back. At the same time, the tattoo is also a message. The 'victim' receives a vision when the tattoo reaches their eyes. Ironically, the vision is the key to solve the curse, but it's a revelation that arrives far too late.\"</p>"},{"location":"2006-Dream_Buyer_and_Baku/#context","title":"Context:","text":"<p>In this interview excerpt, Shibata discusses Japanese legends that tie to one of the major plot points and locations in Fatal Frame: The Tormented.

But I remember mine in great detail.</p> <p>For example, take this dream I had one night. I\u2019m at the Japanese house, and the sound of chanting can be heard from the darkness. People in funeral attire whisk past me down a hall, their faces hidden behind the cloth, their eyes never meeting.

During our experimentation this time, we saw some pretty good prospects for making this happen, so we agreed to give it a shot and got to work with Koei Tecmo Games.</p> <p>MS: A lot of it was because the Wii U made it technically feasible.</p> <p>The reason we went with water this time, though, comes down to my personal experiences. I think it was around 2008, but I was in Los Angeles in the summer, and the experience made me really feel like \u201cI doubt I\u2019d run into any ghosts around here\u201d. Then, when I went back to Japan and immersed myself in the kind of summer humidity you only see in Japan, it made me realize once again how much of a necessary element it was. I think there needs to be a level of moisture in the air in order for ghosts to appear. If the humidity\u2019s high, it feels like you\u2019re surrounded by something larger than yourself; the boundaries between you and the rest of the world grow ambiguous, and I realized that the water becomes an intermediary that connects you with the unseen.</p> <p>I wanted to make this game the culmination of the whole series, so I went with water for the theme. For this game, we made sure there was always water onscreen, from the menus onward. We also put in rain, lakes, rivers, fog, and every other kind of element. When your characters get wet, the clothing sticks to their bodies, which we also put in to help bring that feeling of moisture across.</p> <p>You also have to enter a bath at one point.

Was Hikami Mountain inspired by this? What other elements inspired the game\u2019s story?</p> <p>TO: I think it was Nintendo that proposed the idea of using real occult spots in Japan as motifs for this game. It was based on the idea that a lot of players wanted to experience places like that in a game world, places where anyone would think \u201cThey sound neat, but I wouldn\u2019t want to go near them in real life\u201d. I think that adds more reality to the design, too, using real-life places as motifs.</p> <p>MS: The idea of using the occult spots across Japan as motifs definitely came from Nintendo. When they started by suggesting we use a famous suicide spot as a setting, I thought that was some material I just had to try working with, even if it\u2019d make the story a lot heavier.</p> <p>There are assorted other occult spots that saw use as motifs, too. The ghost experience I had when I visited Mount Osore in Aomori, a place in Japan with a frightening reputation, occupies a lot of weight in my mind. There, I heard a group of children\u2019s voices, continually playing in the forest. A woman walking the same path was crying and sobbing, as if possessed by something, and I fell to the ground, unable to move. That voice was something I should never have heard. It was the kind of voice trying to invite you to the other side.</p> <p>I also went once to Tojinbo, which is a series of oceanside cliffs. Someone had chiseled graffiti into the rocks that read \u201cLife is nothing but sadness, pain, and hatred\u201d. The moment I read it, I felt the sensation of someone lifting me up from behind. I must have had no business reading that inscription, either.</p> <p>In both of those cases, resonating with someone\u2019s emotions led me to receive an invitation to death. I made use of those experiences here, too. In this game, you have the ability to touch ghosts in order to see their cause of death and their secrets.

At first, I thought it was an illusion since I was still in a sleep-like haze, but the cold hand kept hold, slowly increasing strength. \u201cIt hurts! It hurts!\u201d, I screamed, and I finally felt the cold hand pull away before I saw it disappear into a wall. Since I was sleeping against the wall, there was no way anyone could\u2019ve been there.

It\u2019s the same wall that I\u2019ve heard spirits whisper from in the middle of the night. I remember when working on\u00a0Fatal Frame III: The Tormented, I heard a woman\u2019s voice say: \u201cLet\u2019s go swimming.\u201d It shocked me, because that was going to be the ending scene of the game.

We used to gather there as a family, and on this one particular night, my family were the only guests in the hotel, so there was nobody else around. I woke up in the middle of the night, and because the inside of the hotel was only dimly lit by the moonlight shining through the window, the fantasy-like atmosphere lured me to wander around a bit.

As I slowly approached to see who he was, the man looked at me, then quickly disappeared. More curious than scared, I went to the spot where the man was standing. I looked out the window and gazed at the large moon. I stood there looking at the moon for a while until I realized that I was now in the exact same pose as the man I had just seen. I started to wonder, was the man a spirit? Was he a vision of someone\u2019s past? Or did I just see a vision of my future? I knew I wanted to capture a moment like this in the game.</p> <p>Until that moment, I always thought a certain amount of humidity was necessary for spirits to appear, but this was such a low-humidity, dusty environment \u2014 so I tried to not only recreate this moment, but recreate this exact atmosphere inside the hotel for\u00a0Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.\"</p>"},{"location":"2023-Man_in_the_Moonlight/#context","title":"Context:","text":"<p>In this blog excerpt, Shibata describes a paranormal encounter he had as a child that he attributes as inspiration for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.</p> <p>This blog post is written for the release of Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse on the Xbox.

I think we all have scary dreams from time to time, but we usually forget them by the time we wake up. I remember dreams that leave an impression on me, especially scary ones, and I try to take notes when I wake up in order to use them in my games. In fact, there are several map structures in this series that I have repurposed from bad dreams, while some of the spirits are inspired by my nightmares.</p> <p>The spirit named Kageri Sendo in\u00a0Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\u00a0is based on \u201cMiyamoto-san,\u201d a figure who sometimes appeared in my dreams. Miyamoto-san is a slender man who walks around with a person who looks just like him, only in a wheelchair. He is always polite, and bows back at me when I bow, but the person in the wheelchair is what strikes me, as he\u2019s obviously dead and crawling with insects!</p> <p>Sometimes Miyamoto-san is not present and only the wheelchair and the person sitting in it are left unattended. When I try to touch them to see if they are dead, Miyamoto-san angrily runs to me and says, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d And then the supposed corpse would start to move toward me.</p> <p>In\u00a0Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, there is a sanatorium and each floor is inhabited by a unique person. So, of course, when we had a meeting to decide which spirits would appear in the game, it was Miyamoto-san who instantly came to mind.</p> <p>At that time, instead of recreating Miyamoto-san as he was in my dreams, we changed his character to a woman inspired by gothic horror to make her a spirit that users would want to photograph. Some of the staff members suggested that the character\u2019s name should stay as Miyamoto, however, I did not know his first name, and he seemed too weak to be a boss spirit, so we went back to the studio and came up with a name that would be more appropriate for an enemy of the Fatal Frame series, Kageri Sendo.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, though, as Miyamoto-san has not appeared in my dreams since he appeared in the game. Having gained form, maybe he was satisfied to some extent?</p> <p>Because of this, when asked to name the most memorable spirit in\u00a0Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, I always answer Kageri Sendo.\"</p>"},{"location":"2023-Repurposed_From_Bad_Dreams/#context","title":"Context:","text":"<p>In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses being inspired by his dreams, not just paranormal encounters he's had.
