### Title:  Holly and a Snake
### Folklore Type:  legend / folkloresque

### Contents:
"We put the meaning of a curse and black magic on the tattoo. The tattoo is designed with the texture of holly and a snake, and the player will realize that the tattoo is the symbol of pain and it is the pain of living your life. (In ancient Japan, it was believed that the snake was the messenger of God, and holly was a symbol of pain.)"

### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses the Japanese folkloric meaning behind the snake and holly symbols in the tattoo feature of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_.

This excerpt is taken from a series of blog posts, called "Developer Diaries" written ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.  These posts are intended to give insight into the process of developing a given game, as well as act as a source of PR for the game's release.
