### Title:  Condensed Essence of Japanese Horror
### Folklore Type:  [[legend]]

#### Contents:
"\[Stuart]  **For the uninitiated, can you please explain what the _Project Zero_ series is about? How would you say it differs from other horror games like _Resident Evil_ or _Silent Hill_, for example?**Â 

\[Shibata]  Both _Resident Evil_ and _Silent Hill_ are horror games. However, their nature is different from our _Project Zero_ series. The _Project Zero_ games are the condensed essence of Japanese horror, and are all based upon Japanese ghost stories. _Project Zero 3_ (PZ3) takes place in an abandoned manor in Japan, the architecture of which follows a traditional Japanese form. In Japanese horror, fear is not simply generated through surprise; the silence and suspense in-between the action is important too. This silence makes the player's fear build in his or her mind. Japanese horror is always designed this way."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata explains that the _Fatal Frame_ series, also known as the _Project Zero_ series in Japan, takes inspiration from Japanese folklore.

This excerpt is taken from a Q&A originally released by _Take Two_ from which Stuart then edited and copied into an article he posted for _The Guardian_.  This article was published ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_ to North America on the PlayStation 2 platform.
