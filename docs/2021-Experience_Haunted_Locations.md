### Title:  Experience Haunted Locations
### Folklore Type:  personal narrative

### Contents:
"**AL: Are there any memories that stand out to you from working on the Wii U version of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_? Perhaps surrounding its development, a hurdle that the team overcame, or just an anecdote from working on the project?**

**Makoto Shibata:** For the Wii U version, you could use the controller’s screen and the TV screen, so I had to really think about how to utilize both of these in a horror game. The conclusion I came to was that the TV would be the real world and the controller would be the world you see through the Camera Obscura. This would allow the player to experience haunted locations for themselves. By pointing the camera at the world in the TV, ghosts appear in the picture, and the noises the ghosts make in the TV world can be heard through the controller, as if they were slowly coming toward you."

### Context:
In this excerpt of an interview, Shibata discusses using the Wii U controller as a physical representation of the Camera Obscura for the player.  The Wii U controller is a hand-held device that has a screen set in the middle, similar to hand-held gaming devices like the Switch.  The player holds up the Wii U controller, like a camera, to take photos of the ghosts in _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_.

This interview was done by _Noisy Pixel_, marking the remastered release of the fifth game in the series, _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_ in 2021.  The game was originally released in 2015.
