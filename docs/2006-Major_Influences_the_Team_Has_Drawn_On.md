### Title:  Major Influences the Team Has Drawn On
### Folklore Type:

### Contents:
"**What are the major influences the team has drawn on in this game and throughout the series?**Â 

A major influence was the horror movie _Ring_. The last scene, in which Sadako ( the ghost who comes out of the TV) attacks, provided the inspiration for the battle system using the camera. I was shocked by the brilliant way the film created this nightmarish vision of an up-close ghostly experience.

Also, the Manga _Yokai (Monster) Hunter_ series, by Daijiro Moroboshi, inspired me a lot. This Manga deals with themes of Japanese folklore. In this, the hero begins to see another world (the world after death) by accident while he is investigating Japanese folklore. The Manga perfectly re-created typical Japanese images of this netherworld."

### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata describes some of the influences drawn on for _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_.  Alongside the movie _Ring_, he draws form a manga series which also makes use of Japanese folklore.

This excerpt is taken from a Q&A released by _Take Two_ which Stuart then edited and copied into an article he posted on _The Guardian_.  This was published ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_, the third game in the _Fatal Frame_ series.
