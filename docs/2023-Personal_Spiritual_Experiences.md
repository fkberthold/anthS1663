### Title:  Personal Spiritual Experiences
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]], [[dream]]

#### Contents:
"***Justin: Could you speak to your biggest inspirations for Fatal Frame? Is there a process you go through to get yourself in the mindset to create a Fatal Frame?***

**Makoto Shibata:** We have packed the most frightening experiences into a condensed format, tying personal spiritual experiences together with the themes of each title. The initial inspiration is different for each title; for example, “Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly” is the result of a dream I had one night. In “Fatal Frame III: The Tormented”, I wondered if I could use the visit to a scary place in such a dream as a motif in itself."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata discusses using his own encounters with the supernatural and dreams as inspiration for the _Fatal Frame_ series.

This interview was given during the remastered release of _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ to Western audiences.  The original release of this game in 2008 was exclusive to the Nintendo Wii platform.  The game was not officially released in the West until March 2023 following a remaster and subtitled localization.
