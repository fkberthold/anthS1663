### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

#### Contents:
"**Inada:**  So, you know Mr. Kikuchi. Here's a new face, Mr. Shibata. He's actually the director of _Fatal Frame_. We kept him behind the scenes, because he's the one who actually came up with all of the sick ideas. He's the one who actually practices and believes in the spirit world.

**GameSpy:** I remember, a couple of years ago, you had the _Fatal Frame II_ unveiling event, and Kikuchi-san said there's someone in Japan...

**Inada:** That's him. \[Laughs] The infamous guy."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Inada, the general manger for _Tecmo_ USA, is introducing Shibata as the individual on the team responsible for the creation of the _Fatal Frame_ series, as well as someone who actually believes in the paranormal.

This interview was done for the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.
