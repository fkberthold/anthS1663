### Title:  Let the Spirits Emerge
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"In the Japanese game industry, it is customary to visit a shrine and perform a purification ceremony when starting work on a horror title. The purpose of the ceremony is to prevent any spiritual phenomena or disturbances during the game’s development, but for Fatal Frame, we thought it would be better to let the spirits emerge, so we usually don’t do the purification ceremony for games in this series. Because of this, some spirit phenomena occurred during development that was directly reflected in the game – like the time we were recording sound and a mysterious voice was actually recorded in the background. We tried to remove it from the recording, but eventually gave up because no matter what we did, the voice kept coming back onto the recording , so we actually left it in the game!"

### Context:
In this excerpt from a blog post, Shibata discusses an EVP captured during sound recording they were making for one of the _Fatal Frame_ games.  He links this event with the fact that his team did not take participate in purification ceremonies during their work on the series.

This blog post is written for the release of _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ on the Xbox.  The original release of this game took place in Japan in 2008 to the Nintendo Wii platform.  The game was not officially released in the West until March 2023 following a remaster and subtitled localization.
