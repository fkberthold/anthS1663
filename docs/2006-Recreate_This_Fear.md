### Title:  Recreate This Fear
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"\[Stuart] **What makes this the scariest Project Zero game so far?**Â 

\[Shibata] I believe that our method to invoke the fear in the player's own imagination maximizes the recipient's fear. We do not simply show scary things, but provide fragmental information and create a situation that forces the player to imagine these horrors. This is scarier. I personally call it, 'Subtracting horror.'

I'm assuming that other horror game creators base their games on films or novels. However, in my case, I created the audio and the visuals based on my personal ghost experience and nightmares. I try to recreate this fear when people play my games. I think that this fact makes Project Zero 3 the scariest game."

### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata discusses what makes the _Fatal Frame_ series, known as the _Project Zero_ series in Japan, scary.  He believes the series is scary because he is attempting to recreate his own experiences in the game.

This excerpt is taken from a Q&A released by _Take Two_ which Stuart then edited and copied into an article he posted on _The Guardian_.  This was published ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_, the third game in the _Fatal Frame_ series.
