### Title:  Recreate This Fear
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]], [[dream]]

"\[Stuart] **What makes this the scariest Project Zero game so far?**Â 

\[Shibata] I believe that our method to invoke the fear in the player's own imagination maximizes the recipient's fear. We do not simply show scary things, but provide fragmental information and create a situation that forces the player to imagine these horrors. This is scarier. I personally call it, 'Subtracting horror.'

I'm assuming that other horror game creators base their games on films or novels. However, in my case, I created the audio and the visuals based on my personal ghost experience and nightmares. I try to recreate this fear when people play my games. I think that this fact makes Project Zero 3 the scariest game."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata discusses what makes the _Fatal Frame_ series, also known as the _Project Zero_ series in Japan, scary.  Shibata attempts to recreate his own experiences and nightmares in the game, lending realism to the horror.

This excerpt is taken from a Q&A originally released by _Take Two_ from which Stuart then edited and copied into an article he posted for _The Guardian_.  This article was published ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_ to North America on the PlayStation 2 platform.
