### Title:  Ghosts I Have Seen in Real Life
### Folklore Type:

### Contents:
"**HPP: The Fatal Frame series has introduced us to many terrifying spirits over the past two decades. Can you tell us where the team draws their inspiration from when it comes to creating these unsettling apparitions?**

**Shibata:**Â When creating each title, we start by settling on the theme, and then we come up with ghosts that are in line with it or that can embody the theme itself. The order we went in was: coming up with the religion and rituals, the people that formulated the rituals, and the people who are sacrificed in these rituals and the ghosts that will appear in the game.

In addition, I go over the ghosts I have seen in real life and add the ones that fit in with the theme of the game."

### Context:
In the interview excerpt, Shibata discusses what inspirations he and his team draw on for the _Fatal Frame_ series, noting that he reviews his own personal encounters as part of the process of story development.

This interview was given for the remastered release of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_.  The original 2014-2015 release was a Nintendo Wii U exclusive.  The remastered edition, released in 2021, updated the game for modern consoles and the PC.
