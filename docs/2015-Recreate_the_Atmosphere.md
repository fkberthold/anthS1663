### Title:  Recreate the Atmosphere
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]], [[folkloresque]]

#### Contents:
"\[Siliconera]  **Let’s talk about the art of a horror game, scaring players. Some games use jump scares other games are atmospheric. How do you like to scare players? What are some of your favorite techniques that you used in Maiden of the Black Water?**

MS: The most important thing across the entire series is that atmosphere where it’s like something’s watching you and something might come out at any time. I think that having this area that makes you feel like something used to be here, and having you wander through it, is one of the best situations for a spiritually-oriented horror game.

Unlike other media like films and novels, players control characters in video games, allowing us to depict a spatial setting for them. In these games, I try my best to recreate the atmosphere of the spaces I was in just before seeing ghosts as much as possible. I want to have players use their imagination in these spaces, letting it fill them with fear as they explore.

The differences you notice when revisiting the same place are also important in psychological horror. For example, there are different sequences when you enter the doll-lined temple in this game between the first time and the second time. I like adding these slight differences in sound and objects to stimulate players’ imaginations."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata discusses using his own experiences and feelings to inform the "atmosphere" he creates in the games for players.

This interview was given ahead of the the European and North American release of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_ for the Nintendo Wii U console in 2015.  This is the fifth game in the primary series.  The game is later remastered for release to modern consoles and the PC in 2021.
