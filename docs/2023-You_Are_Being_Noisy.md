### Title:  You Are Being Noisy
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

### Contents:
"While working on the series, there has been a recurring spiritual phenomenon in every title. Whenever I stayed over at the office, the spirit of a child would run around at night. It seemed like a boy, judging by his footsteps and voice. He would play tricks throughout the night, knocking over books and papers on my desk if I didn’t pay attention to him. When I would say, “Urusai!”, which means, “you’re being noisy”, the boy would quickly disappear."

### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata describes a paranormal encounter with a child he had while working on the _Fatal Frame_ series.  Ghosts of children feature throughout the _Fatal Frame_ series, and are often depicted playing games similar to hide-and-seek, or tag.

This blog post is written for the release of _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ on the Xbox.  The original release of this game in 2008 was exclusive to the Nintendo Wii platform.  The game was not officially released in the West until March 2023 following a remaster and subtitled localization.
