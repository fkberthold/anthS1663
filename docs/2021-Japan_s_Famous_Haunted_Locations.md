### Title:  Japan's Famous Haunted Locations
### Folklore Type:  [[legend]], [[folkloresque]]

#### Contents:
"**HPP: The Fatal Frame stories are known for playing off of Japanese myths and folklore. Can you tell us how any of these elements have been incorporated into Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water?**

**Shibata:** During the development process, we incorporated a number of Japan’s famous haunted locations as well as the fear that encompasses those areas into this game. For most of us, visiting one of these locations is incredibly rare. For that reason I felt like there was a lot of value in allowing players to have these experiences through this game. I also incorporated my experiences from a time I went to one of these locations in the past.

In order to collect all of these frightening experiences into one game, we created a fictional mountain and religion to include in the story. While it is a work of fiction, I think we came up with a religion that could realistically exist as one of Japan’s indigenous belief systems."

#### Context:
In the interview excerpt, Shibata discusses using Japanese locations known for their supernatural folklore as inspiration for the story and locations of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_.

This interview was given for the remastered release of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_.  The original 2014/2015 release was a Nintendo Wii U exclusive.  The remastered edition, released in 2021, updated the game for modern consoles and the PC.
