### Title:  Find Ways to Commercialize Shibata's Ideas
### Folklore Type:  

#### Contents:
"**GameSpy:** Something that you had talked about earlier, Kikuchi-san, is that you don't believe in the occult but Shibata-san does. I was wondering if you could tell me more about that, and if that affects the development going back and forth?

**Kikuchi:** Absolutely no problem.  

**Shibata:** There's really no problem because if I say "this is good" or "this is interesting" or "this is something that we should do," then Kikuchi can say yes or no -- mostly yes.  

**Kikuchi:** My job is to basically balance out everything that Shibata wants to do. If we did everything that he wants to do, or what he has in his vision, it's not going to fit in our capacity that we're given. My job is to basically find ways to commercialize Shibata's ideas."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Kikuchi and Shibata discuss their roles in deciding what makes it into a _Fatal Frame_ game.  While Shibata is a believer in the supernatural, it is implied here that Kikuchi is not.

This interview was done for the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.
