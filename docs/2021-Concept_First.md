### Title:  Concept First
### Folklore Type:  [[folkloresque]]

#### Contents:
"**BD: A lot of games have been influenced by** **_Fatal Frame_****’s approach to horror over the years, which dilutes its impact somewhat. Was it hard to innovate whilst trying to stick to the traditional scares fans loved?**

**KK:** For us, as we make new entries in the series we are not trying to keep escalating the shocking aspects of the horror elements. For every title, we decide on the concept first and then focus on bringing horror contents to players that revolve around that concept. For example, in the first title, the main concepts are “condensing the Japanese sense of fear” and “fear that defies your imagination,” for the second title it was “horror from legends,” and for the third title it was “going between reality and dreams, and mechanisms in reality that causes fear to spread.” In this entry in the series, our main theme is “experiencing fear through a location that condenses Japan’s “haunted places.” We have made it so that you can experience different kinds of fear through each title. As each entry in the series has a different approach to fear, each player will have their own favorite title or their own opinion on which is the most frightening."
