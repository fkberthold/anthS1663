### Title:  Ghost Who Had a Damaged Face
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

#### Contents:
"\[Stuart] **Have you ever seen a ghost? If so, what would your advice be to anyone who encounters one?**Â 

\[Shibata] Yes, of course I have. However, I can give no advice. I myself am really scared every time I see one, and you cannot predict when you will have an encounter. I once saw a ghost who had a damaged face and I couldn't figure out if it was a he or a she. I was kind of panicked and pretended that I was dead."
 
#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Shibata describes a paranormal encounter he had in childhood.

This excerpt is taken from a Q&A originally released by _Take Two_ from which Stuart then edited and copied into an article he posted for _The Guardian_.  This article was published ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: The Tormented_ to North America on the PlayStation 2 platform.
