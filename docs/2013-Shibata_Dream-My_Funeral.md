### Title:  Shibata Dream: My Funeral
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"For inspiration, I looked to my own dreams and supernatural experiences. In my dreams, I often visit a Japanese-style house like the one in the series. The Fatal Frame world takes its inspiration from my terrifying nightmares. Of course, everyone has really scary nightmares every now and then, but most people usually forget them once they wake up. But I remember mine in great detail.

For example, take this dream I had one night. I’m at the Japanese house, and the sound of chanting can be heard from the darkness. People in funeral attire whisk past me down a hall, their faces hidden behind the cloth, their eyes never meeting. When I give in to my curiosity and peer through the openings in the cloth at one of the faces, I realize it’s someone I know. Someone I know to be dead. I follow him down the hall until we reach the site of a funeral.

My funeral. The moment I realize this, every one of the attendants turns toward me.

In this dream, what happens next is usually what I’m dreading the most, probably because I’m telling myself, 'This is the last thing I want to happen,' and my brain takes its cue from that. In this series, we try to adhere faithfully to this literal 'nightmare scenario.'"

### Context:
In this excerpt from a blog post, Shibata discusses one of the dreams that inspired the location and narrative of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_.  Funerals, death, and grief are all major themes in this game, alongside the intrusion of the dream world onto the waking world.

This blog post is the third of three Shibata wrote for _PlayStation.blog_, and this one marks the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ onto the PlayStation Network for digital download.
