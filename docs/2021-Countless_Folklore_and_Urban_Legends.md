### Title:  Countless Folklore and Urban Legends
### Folklore Type:  [[legend]]

#### Contents:
"**_BD: Maiden of Black Water_****, as with previous entries, features fictional tales and folklore, but are clearly grounded in reality to some degree. What real Japanese folklore served as inspiration for** **_Maiden of Black Water_****?**

**KK:** In _Maiden of Black Water_ we made a game out of the “haunted locations” we have in Japan, utilizing this as the main motif, and as the story itself is original, we didn’t have any specific influencers from urban legends. Nevertheless, the series director, Mr. Shibata writes all of the scenarios, and he has perused countless folklore and urban legends. As a result, there would be influences from these topics in the game from his imagination, as well as his own personal experiences with ghosts, which make their way into the original stories he creates."

#### Context:
In this interview excerpt, Kikuchi, producer of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_, discusses how influences for the game are drawn from many different folkloric sources, including Shibata's personal experiences with the paranormal.

This interview was done by _Bloody Disgusting_ for the remastered release of _Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water_ in 2021.  The original 2014/2015 release was a Nintendo Wii U exclusive.  The remastered edition, released in 2021, updated the game for modern consoles and the PC.
