### Title:  Recreating That Uncountable Feeling
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"We tried to emotionally reach out to players and get them to feel things they cannot actually see on screen.

As a result, we selected the horror genre, which was an area aligned with my personal interests since I tend to “see” things myself every now and then in real life. In other words, my experience of seeing things that weren’t actually there — or noticing abnormal things around me — were some of the fear factors I thought would appeal to the emotional side of the player, if we were able to embed them on top of the adventure side of the gameplay.

The initial research of the new PS2 hardware led us to the conclusion that we would be able to recreate some of the ways I experienced seeing “things” in real life. Also the existence of Silent Hill was beneficial for us in seeing how well polygon-created horrors were accepted by the players. As a result, our task was to take it a step further and get players to feel things they couldn’t see on screen, recreating that uncountable feeling one tends to experience in certain rooms and locations like in real life."

### Context:
In this excerpt from a blog post, Shibata is discussing the conception and development of the original _Fatal Frame_ game.  For Shibata, creating this game was an opportunity to "recreate" the experience and feelings he had felt with his own paranormal encounters.

This blog post was one of three that Shibata wrote for _PlayStation.blog_ during 2013.  This blog post marks the release of the original _Fatal Frame_ game to the PlayStation Network, making the game to be available for digital download for the first time.
