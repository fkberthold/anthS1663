### Title:  Dead People Are Watching the Game
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"For me, it is not just a video game, but precious artwork, created with careful detail. I strongly believe that the game experience of _Fatal Frame III_ will be special in video-game history. I hope that you play the game and have this artistic experience.  
  
One of the reasons that I paid attention to details on this game is that dead people are watching the game while you are playing. I know it. And dead people would care in detail. This game is also for dead people, and I can proudly show the game to them."

### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata asserts his belief that the dead are watching as a player plays through _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_.

This excerpt is taken from a series of blog posts, called "Developer Diaries" written ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.  These posts are intended to give insight into the process of developing a given game, as well as act as a source of PR for the game's release.
