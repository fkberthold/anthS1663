### Title:  Abandoned Japanese House
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"This is an aside, but when the game idea of _Fatal Frame III_ came to me, I decided to model the game after an old, abandoned Japanese house where I played in my childhood. The house did not have a door, was crumbled inside, was dark even on a sunny day, and had the atmosphere that something like ghosts were in there. My friends and I played a game with the house. The rule of the game was that you had to bring something out of the house, such as a piece of paper, a book, a broken doll, or something like that. And we imagined what had happened in the house based on those items we brought out. It was thrilling to go into somewhere you shouldn't and collect fragmentary information there. I wanted to put a part of this thrill in the game.  

(One day, I saw an old woman pushing a baby carriage in the house. I do not know if she was a ghost or real, but she should not have been there anyway. The old woman appears in my game.)"

### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses his childhood experience in an abandoned house that inspires a location in _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_.  He also describes a paranormal encounter which makes it into the game as an enemy ghost.

This excerpt is taken from a series of blog posts, called "Developer Diaries" written ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.  These posts are intended to give insight into the process of developing a given game, as well as act as a source of PR for the game's release.
