### Title:  She Was Singing Them
### Folklore Type:  memorate

### Contents:
"For _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_, the original version of the game wasn’t made at Koei Tecmo’s studio, but at Grasshopper Manufacture’s studio, so we never saw the spirit of the boy, but they had this ping pong table that I used to sleep on when we were working on the game late into the evening, and every once in a while, I would see the spirit of a girl who would circle around the table, running slowly and quietly. If I didn’t respond when seeing her, she would walk over to the window and sing a song. “Four, four, six…” Apparently, she was singing numbers in the form of verses. I could never hear the end clearly, but I thought this was a message that they wanted me to include in the game, so I decided to include an event where a girl says numbers as if she was singing them."

### Context:
In this excerpt from a blog post, Shibata describes a paranormal encounter with the ghost of a girl singing numbers.  He incorporates this in _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ in a series of cut scenes where the player hears a girl singing the code to a door lock.

This blog post is written ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ on the Xbox.  The original release of this game took place in Japan in 2008 to the Nintendo Wii platform.  The game was not officially released in the West until March 2023 following a remaster and subtitled localization.
