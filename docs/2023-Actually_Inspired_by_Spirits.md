### Title:  Actually Inspired by Spirits
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

#### Contents:
"My name is Makoto Shibata and I’ve been working on the Fatal Frame series since its inception, trying to create the scariest games possible in a way that’s unique to other horror titles. What people might not realize when they play my games is that some of what you see in the series – and some of what you’ll play in Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse – was actually inspired by spirits that I’ve seen (and even touched!) in real life. To me, zombies and monsters aren’t scary because they’re not real, but spirits have been a frightening presence in my life since I was young. I wanted to bring some of my scariest sightings to the games I created, helping capture some of the moments that have kept me up at night, hoping to do the same to gamers around the world."

#### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses how the _Fatal Frame_ series is inspired by his own experiences of the paranormal.

This blog post is written for the release of _Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse_ on the Xbox.  The original release of this game in 2008 was exclusive to the Nintendo Wii platform.  The game was not officially released in the West until March 2023 following a remaster and subtitled localization.
