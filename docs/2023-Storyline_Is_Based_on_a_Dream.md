### Title:  Storyline Is Based on a Dream
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]], [[dream]]

#### Contents:
"The storyline \[for _Fatal Frame 2_] is based on a dream I had after the initial project concluded. Thinking back about it, I recall it being a complete dream in many ways. The dream was scary, magical and traumatic, and it had a perfect plot â€” even with a title and a structured ending. Thus, it was simply a case of how to interpret the dream and recreate it as a game."

#### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses how the narrative for _Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly_ comes from one of his dreams. 

This blog post was the second of three he wrote for the _PlayStation.blog_ site.  This blog post was made just ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly_ to the PlayStation Network, making the game available for digital download for the first time.
