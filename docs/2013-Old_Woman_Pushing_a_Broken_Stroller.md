### Title:  Old Woman Pushing a Broken Stroller
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

#### Contents:
"The world of Fatal Frame III is full of these kind of dreams and supernatural experiences of mine. But to go into detail here would spoil the game, so you’ll have to play and see for yourself. Instead, I’ll talk about an encounter I once had with a ghost.

The system in Fatal Frame III that lets you see pictures in the real world that were taken in the dream world comes from a game I used to play with my friends when I was a child.

In our neighborhood there was a run-down, abandoned, Japanese-style house. Each of us would enter one at a time and bring back something from inside, which we would then make up a story about and show off to our friends.

One time, it was my turn. Thinking of getting it over with as soon as possible, I hurried to the back room and picked up a baby doll. It was the kind that speaks when a string on its back is pulled. When I tried pulling the string, the voice was distorted and broken. It was impossible to tell what it was saying.

Just then, I heard the sound of grating metal. It come closer and closer until it reached the room I was in. It was an old woman pushing a broken stroller. I threw the doll to give it back to her and sped out of the house as fast as I could.

Looking back, it hardly makes sense that someone would be pushing a stroller through an abandoned house with broken floorboards that no one had lived in for years. I don’t think that lady was from the real world.

I never did tell my friends about the old woman, but she appears in the game as a hostile spirit."
