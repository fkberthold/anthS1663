### Title:  The Tattoo Has Magic Meanings
### Folklore Type:  legend

### Contents:
"In this title, the tattoo is the key in respect to both the story and visual imagery. First, let me talk about Japanese tattoos. Tattoos -- the small ones -- became a fashion item and became accepted by people. However, the traditional Japanese type of tattoo sometimes covered all of your back or even all of your body. The tattoo has magic meanings such that the drawing gives power to the tattooed person. It is a kind of animism and is mysterious."

### Context:
In this blog excerpt, Shibata discusses the folkloric nature of a tattoo in Japanese culture.  A tattoo features as a major story point in _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_.

This excerpt is taken from a series of blog posts, called "Developer Diaries" written ahead of the release of _Fatal Frame III: The Tormented_ for North America in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 platform.  These posts are intended to give insight into the process of developing a given game, as well as act as a source of PR for the game's release.
