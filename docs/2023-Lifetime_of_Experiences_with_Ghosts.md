### Title:  Lifetime of Experiences with Ghosts
### Folklore Type:  [[memorate]]

#### Contents:
"Makoto Shibata, director and co-creator of the Fatal Frame series, coexists with his hauntings. In its conception, he set out to make the scariest horror games available. This task sounds possible when considering Shibata says he has a lifetime of experiences with ghosts, which he has featured in the series in varying degrees.

Ever since he was a kid, overhearing what he describes as a ghost parade that seemingly travelled between two shrines close to his home, heʼs always seen the world through a supernatural lens. “Being able to provide players with an unusual experience, showing this world that only I can see, is something I find interesting,” Shibata says.

During an hour-long chat alongside producer Yutaka Fukaya, Shibata often responds to my questions and excitedly retells stories I came across while reading past interviews. His hand was grabbed by a ghost who asked to “go swimming together,” mimicking the pose of an unknown guest he found in a hotel where only he and his relatives were staying, and a recurrent “Slender Man-like” appearance in his dreams called Mr. Miyamoto all come up in our chat.

Since I knew about Mr. Miyamoto beforehand, I ask Shibata if this presence continues to visit his dreams. “Sometimes, sometimes,” he answers with a serious tone. “Once I put \[him] in a game for a while, it doesnʼt show up, so itʼs kind of like heʼs satisfied after being put in the game. But he does appear sometimes still.”"

#### Context:
In this article excerpt, Shibata is quoted talking about using his personal experiences with ghosts and his dreams as inspiration for the games he's created.

This excerpt comes from an article written for _Game Informer_, the digital counterpart to _Game Informer Magazine_.  For this article, Argüello had conversations with game developers who are known for their horror games, exploring what inspires them.
